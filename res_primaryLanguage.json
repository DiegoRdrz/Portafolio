      "description": "I'm Diego, I'm 23 years old and a full stack developer. I mainly work with Spring Boot on the backend and React on the frontend. I also have experience with other languages like Node.js, Python, and C#, which allows me to adapt easily to different development environments. I'm comfortable working with both relational and non-relational databases, and I have knowledge of cloud services like AWS and Azure. I enjoy building solid, well-structured, and scalable solutions. I always strive to write clean, maintainable code and follow best practices in everything I do.",

        "description": "Lately, I've been working on two projects related to artificial intelligence. The first is a virtual assistant-style chatbot designed to hold natural conversations and provide psychological help to people, and also has a function to detect the probability that a user may be suffering from depression. The second is a convolutional neural network model focused on detecting potential cancer cases from skin images, combining computer vision and classification techniques. I've developed both projects as part of my interest in applying AI to real-world problems.",
